# Streams Import Module
==============

An awesome module to help you to import data into Streams for PyroCMS.

## Installation

Download and install the module through the Admin or Manually

## How to use

### Profiles

Profiles can be used to setup a common import you will run multiple times. A Profile will store your destination Stream and field mapping to eliminate these steps in the future.

#### Run an import.

If you have not created a profile, do so now. A Profile will contain all of the "config" type info for future imports.

Once your profile is created, you can click on __Run__ which will propose you to select a File you've uploaded in Files Module, and will import it instantly.
